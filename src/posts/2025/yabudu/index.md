## Yabudu — Making Event Registration Effortless

Organizing small group events might sound simple — until you’ve tried doing it through a group chat. Whether it’s a local tennis club, a study circle, or a table-tennis group, coordinating who’s coming can quickly turn into a flurry of messages, crossed wires, and last-minute confusion.

That’s the everyday problem I set out to solve with **[Yabudu](https://github.com/sergeyt/yabudu)** — a modern web app that simplifies how people **register for upcoming events in shared spaces**.

### From chaos to clarity

In places like table-tennis clubs, where the number of available tables is limited, having ten people sign up for eight spots is more than a minor inconvenience — it’s a scheduling headache. Traditional messaging tools like WhatsApp or Telegram aren’t designed to manage such constraints.

Yabudu replaces those scattered messages with a **clear, structured interface**. Participants can see all upcoming events, register with one click, check who’s already signed up, and instantly know if a session is full. No confusion, no overbooking — just clarity and fairness.

### A story of iteration and growth

This isn’t my first time tackling this kind of problem. **Eight years ago**, while mentoring students at **Novosibirsk State University (NSU)**, I built a similar app in **Golang**. Back then, the goal was to help coordinate student projects and events more efficiently.

That early version taught me the importance of simplicity and reliability. Yabudu is its modern successor — rebuilt from the ground up using **Next.js**, and designed to demonstrate not only how far web technology has come, but also how much I’ve grown as a **full-stack engineer**.

### Beyond code — a showcase of craftsmanship

Yabudu highlights my ability to take a real-world coordination problem, design a user-friendly solution, and implement it end-to-end. It brings together everything I value in software engineering:

* **Empathy for users**, by solving a tangible pain point
* **Clean, scalable design**, ensuring every interaction feels intuitive
* **Ownership from concept to deployment**, demonstrating independence and accountability

### Why it matters

While Yabudu may seem like a small app, it reflects a larger philosophy — that technology should make human coordination smoother and more transparent. It’s a simple idea brought to life through thoughtful design and technical precision.

For me, Yabudu isn’t just a side project. It’s a reflection of how I approach problems: observe, simplify, and build something that just works.

Would you like me to tailor this further for **LinkedIn publication** (with a strong opening hook, shorter paragraphs, and a closing call-to-action about your skills or availability)? That version tends to perform best when HR or hiring managers are the primary audience.
